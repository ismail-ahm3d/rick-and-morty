 app is based on https://rickandmortyapi.com.

It is still under development.

What's used in the app:

- Android Jetpack Navigation 
- Navigation Safe Args for passing args and bundles between fragments or activities 
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Retrofit2 for network requests
- Room persistence library for DB operations
- ViewBinding
- Modularization is used as well
- Kotlin Coroutines for doing asynchronous programming

**TODO** Changing the design of the app from xml layouts to jetpack compose UI tool.
